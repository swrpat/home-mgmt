# Home Management (Placeholder name)

This is an app I build mainly for personal use to manage multiple facets of daily life. It will help answer questions like these:

- (Grocery)How much do I usually pay for this item?
- When should I replace the water filter?
- Are my cats up to date with their vaccinations?

The list goes on but the features will be catching up slowly.
